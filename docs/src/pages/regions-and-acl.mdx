## Regions

UploadThing allows you to select where your files are stored by configuring your
app's region on the UploadThing dashboard. If no configuration is set, your
files are uploaded to our default region which is currently `AWS us-west-2`.

### Configuring region

Go to your app's settings on the UploadThing dashboard. Under `Regions and ACL`,
you can select the region you want to upload your files to. Once changed, all
**new** file uploads will go to the selected region.

<Callout type="info">
  Changing your app's region will not move your existing files to the new
  region, it will only affect new files. For assistance migrating your existing
  files to the new region, please reach out on [Discord](https://t3.gg/discord)
  or via [email](mailto:ut-support@ping.gg).

## Access Controls

By default every file uploaded to UploadThing is accessible simply by it's URL
(`utfs.io/f/FILE_KEY`). Although this hard-to-guess URL is fine for many
applications, some applications require a more secure way to store their files.

You can configure your app's access control list (ACL) to restrict access to
your files. UploadThing currently supports two different ACLs:

- `public-read`: Files will be accessible simply by it's URL.
- `private`: Private files will not be accessible by it's URL, but instead will
  require a short-lived signed URL to be accessed.

### Configuring ACL

To configure your app's ACL, go to your app's settings on the UploadThing
dashboard. Under `Regions and ACL`, you can select the ACL you want to use as
default. You may also toggle the ability to override the default ACL on a
per-request basis.

  Private files are currently only available on regions other than the default
  (`AWS us-west-2`).

### Using signed URLs

Signed URLs can be retrieved using the
[`getSignedURL`](/api-reference/server#getsignedurl) method on the UTApi. It
accepts the expiration time in seconds as a parameter, which defaults to
whatever you've set in your app's settings. Overriding this value is only
allowed if you've enabled the
`Allow overriding this value on a per-request basis` setting on your app's
settings.
